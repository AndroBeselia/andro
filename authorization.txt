dirsearch - u url -w db/dicc.txt

We got some routes: /auth, /client_secrets.json, /robots.txt, /secrets. 

We are not allowed to use GET requests because we got some error, 
so let’s try to use POST  requests

POST /auth HTTP/1.1

At this moment we can notice some flask errors that are triggered
But we notice some strange parameters such as: (JWT_AUTH_USERNAME_KEY and
JWT_AUTH_PASSWORD_KEY) which are in json format 
(keep in mind data is in json
format).
We need to get users credentials to do some requests on this page.
For this point let’s check another interesting route: /client_secrets.json

After this step, we obtain the user credentials, but we don’t have the JWT_AUTH token for what
we got. Let's go back to the /auth route and try again to do a POST request with the credentials obtained above.
 


in burp
POST /auth
{ 
	"username":"admin",
	"password":"admin"
}


Now let's go to the secret route and add the JWT token authorization to get the flag.


GET /secrets 

Content-type: application/json
Authrization: JWT
{JWT}
