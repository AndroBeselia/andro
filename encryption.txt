When we open wireshark file, I filtered http protocol. When I filtered http I got file, which was hashed and urlcoded, so I thought that there will be hint, so I opened it and found value input. When I decoded this value i got “RPFP{qq545sos12sq608qnn8p201s50s95p8520orp9s744n3573o1qp0op53pr019726}”, that means that I need several step to get flag. We have hint that this challenge was published by European Cyber Security Challenge(ECSC), that probably means that flag should start with ESCS. As we have flag format which is starting with RPFP, we need to decode this flag as to got ECSC so I used rot-13 decode format to replace “R” by “E” and more, because length from “R” to “E” is 13, so when I decode flag which I have in this time I got exact flag which I needed “ECSC{dd545fbf12fd608daa8c201f50f95c8520bec9f744a3573b1dc0bc53ce019726}”.
